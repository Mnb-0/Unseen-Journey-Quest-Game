**Introduction**

The Unseen Journey Quest is a terminal-based game created using the ncurses library, which allows for manipulating the terminal screen and handling user input. The game offers an engaging experience through a simple, text-based interface.

“Trapped in a dark maze, you can only see the ground beneath your feet. Somewhere in the shadows, a hidden key unlocks the way out, but you can’t see it, and you don’t know where it is. You can sense when you’re moving closer to the key, guiding your steps through the darkness.”
